# Java Double Data Type

The `double` data type in Java represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point number. It is a primitive data type used to store decimal numbers with a wide range and higher precision compared to the `float` data type.

## Class Double

The `Double` class is a wrapper class for the `double` data type in Java. It provides various utility methods to work with `double` values. However, when declaring variables of the `double` type directly, you don't need to use the `Double` class explicitly.

### Fields

- `POSITIVE_INFINITY` - A constant representing positive infinity.
- `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` - A constant representing negative infinity.
- `NaN` - A constant representing "Not-a-Number" (undefined value).

### Methods

The `double` data type provides several methods to perform arithmetic and comparison operations, such as `doubleValue()`, `intValue()`, `isNaN()`, and `compareTo()`. Additionally, the `Double` class offers methods like `parseDouble()` and `valueOf()` to parse and convert strings to `double` values.

### Usage Example

```java
double temperature = 25.5;
System.out.println("The current temperature is: " + temperature);

double pi = 3.14159;
System.out.println("The value of pi is approximately: " + pi);

double a = 1.5;
double b = 2.3;
double sum = a + b;
System.out.println("The sum of a and b is: " + sum);

double difference = b - a;
System.out.println("The difference between b and a is: " + difference);
```

In the example above, we declare a `double` variable named `temperature` to store the current temperature. The value `25.5` is assigned to it, and we print the temperature to the console.

We also declare a `double` variable named `pi` to store an approximation of the mathematical constant Pi. The value `3.14159` is assigned to it, and we print the value of Pi to the console.

The example demonstrates arithmetic operations using `double` variables. We declare `double` variables `a` and `b` and assign values `1.5` and `2.3` to them, respectively. We perform addition and subtraction operations and store the results in the `double` variables `sum` and `difference`.

The `double` data type provides a higher level of precision and a wider range compared to the `float` data type. It is commonly used when greater accuracy is required in decimal calculations or when dealing with very large or very small decimal values.
