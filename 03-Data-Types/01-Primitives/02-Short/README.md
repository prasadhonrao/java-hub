# Short Data Type

The `short` class in Java is a primitive data type that represents a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It is used to store integer values within the range of -32,768 to 32,767.

## Two's Complement Integer Representation

In two's complement representation, the leftmost bit (most significant bit, or MSB) is the sign bit. If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive, and if it is 1, the number is negative. The remaining bits represent the magnitude of the number.

Negative numbers in two's complement are obtained by inverting all the bits of the positive number representation and then adding 1 to the result. This ensures that the MSB remains the sign bit. Conversely, to obtain the positive representation from the negative two's complement, invert the bits and add 1.

For example:

- Positive binary representation of 100: 0000000001100100
- Two's complement of -100: 1111111110011100
- To get the decimal value of -100, invert the bits and add 1: 1111111110011100 -> 0000000001100011 + 1 = 0000000001100100 (decimal 100)

## Fields

- `MIN_VALUE`: The minimum value that a `short` can represent. It is -32,768.
- `MAX_VALUE`: The maximum value that a `short` can represent. It is 32,767.

## Methods

The `short` class does not define any additional methods beyond those inherited from the `java.lang.Number` superclass. However, it can be used in various arithmetic and logical operations in Java.

## Usage Example

```java
short temperature = -1000;
System.out.println("The current temperature is: " + temperature);

short numberOfStudents = 30000;
System.out.println("The number of students in the class is: " + numberOfStudents);

short a = 1000;
short b = 2000;
short sum = (short) (a + b);
System.out.println("The sum of a and b is: " + sum);

short difference = (short) (b - a);
System.out.println("The difference between b and a is: " + difference);
```

In the example above, we declare a `short` variable named `temperature` to store the current temperature. The value `-1000` is assigned to it, which is within the valid range for a `short`. We then print the temperature to the console.

We also declare a `short` variable named `numberOfStudents` to store the number of students in a class. The value `30000` is assigned to it, which is also within the valid range for a `short`. We print the number of students to the console as well.

The example also demonstrates arithmetic operations using `short` variables. We declare `short` variables `a` and `b` and assign values `1000` and `2000` to them, respectively. We perform addition and subtraction operations and store the results in `short` variables `sum` and `difference`. Note that explicit casting to `short` is necessary when assigning the result of the arithmetic operations to `short` variables.

By using the `short` data type, you can efficiently store and manipulate integer values within the valid range, taking advantage of the two's complement representation for handling negative numbers.
