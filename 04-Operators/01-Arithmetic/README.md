# Java Arithmetic Operators

In Java, arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values. Java provides a set of arithmetic operators that allow you to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## Addition (`+`)

The addition operator `+` is used to add two operands together.

```java
int sum = 10 + 5; // 15
```

## Subtraction (`-`)

The subtraction operator `-` is used to subtract the right operand from the left operand.

```java
int difference = 10 - 5; // 5
```

## Multiplication (`*`)

The multiplication operator `*` is used to multiply two operands.

```java
int product = 10 * 5; // 50
```

## Division (`/`)

The division operator `/` is used to divide the left operand by the right operand.

```java
int quotient = 10 / 5; // 2
```

Note that if both operands are integers, the result will be an integer. If you want to obtain a floating-point result, you can use the appropriate data type.

## Modulo/Remainder (`%`)

The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.

```java
int remainder = 10 % 3; // 1
```

In the example above, `10` divided by `3` is `3` with a remainder of `1`.

## Increment (`++`)

The increment operator `++` is used to increase the value of a variable by `1`.

```java
int num = 5;
num++; // num is now 6
```

## Decrement (`--`)

The decrement operator `--` is used to decrease the value of a variable by `1`.

```java
int num = 5;
num--; // num is now 4
```

## Compound Assignment Operators

Java also provides compound assignment operators that combine an arithmetic operation with assignment.

```java
int num = 10;
num += 5; // Equivalent to num = num + 5; (num is now 15)
```

In the example above, `+=` is a compound assignment operator that adds `5` to the variable `num` and assigns the result back to `num`.

These are some of the basic arithmetic operators in Java. They allow you to perform various mathematical operations on numeric values, making Java a powerful language for numerical computations.
