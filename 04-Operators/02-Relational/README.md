# Java Relational Operators

In Java, relational operators are used to compare the relationship between two values or expressions. They evaluate to a boolean result, either `true` or `false`, indicating whether the comparison is true or false.

## Equality (`==`)

The equality operator `==` checks if the values of two operands are equal.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
boolean isEqual = (a == b); // false
```

In the example above, `isEqual` will be `false` because the values of `a` and `b` are not equal.

## Inequality (`!=`)

The inequality operator `!=` checks if the values of two operands are not equal.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
boolean isNotEqual = (a != b); // true
```

In the example above, `isNotEqual` will be `true` because the values of `a` and `b` are not equal.

## Greater Than (`>`)

The greater than operator `>` checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
boolean isGreater = (a > b); // false
```

In the example above, `isGreater` will be `false` because `a` is not greater than `b`.

## Less Than (`<`)

The less than operator `<` checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
boolean isLess = (a < b); // true
```

In the example above, `isLess` will be `true` because `a` is less than `b`.

## Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)

The greater than or equal to operator `>=` checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
boolean isGreaterOrEqual = (a >= b); // false
```

In the example above, `isGreaterOrEqual` will be `false` because `a` is not greater than or equal to `b`.

## Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)

The less than or equal to operator `<=` checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
boolean isLessOrEqual = (a <= b); // true
```

In the example above, `isLessOrEqual` will be `true` because `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

These relational operators allow you to compare values and expressions in Java, helping you make decisions based on the relationships between different variables or values.
